## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

In this project I wanted to use custom variables and relative metrics in order to provide for best usability across devices and better code review.

### What I learned

While I thought this would be just another simple challenge that would cement my CSS knowledge, I actually had a moderately hard time trying to figure out how to make all the images, texts and titles in the correct position. I ended up using flexbox styles, since all the other attempts failed.

### Continued development

Although theoretically I feel I understand flexbox and grid, in practice I struggle with the item-container relationship and how to manage the styles. Right now I feel I use test/fail approach all the time without actually knowing what to expect in each situation. I would like to improve this in future projects.
